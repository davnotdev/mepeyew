# Examples

Hello, these are `mepeyew`'s examples.

You can run them for desktop platforms using `cargo r --example ...`.

## Notes for Desktop

All of these examples are designed to run identically on web and desktop platforms.
However, if you do not plan on supporting web, you can have a look at the
`desktop_hello_triangle.rs` and `desktop_template.rs` examples.

## Notes for WebAssembly

### Running the Examples

You can run these examples for web using `cargo run-wasm --example ...`.
Please consult the [documentation](docs.rs/mepeyew) for support details.
